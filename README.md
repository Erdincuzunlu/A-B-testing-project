A/B Testing - Control vs Test Group Analysis

This project demonstrates a simple A/B testing process using Python.
We check whether there is a statistically significant difference between the purchasing behaviors of two groups: Control Group and Test Group.

ðŸ“„ Project Content
	â€¢	Data Reading (pandas)
	â€¢	Hypothesis Setting
	â€¢	Normality Test (Shapiro-Wilk Test)
	â€¢	Variance Homogeneity Test (Levene Test)
	â€¢	Independent Two-Sample T-Test (equal variance assumed)
	â€¢	Final Decision and Interpretation

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
	â€¢	Python 3
	â€¢	pandas
	â€¢	numpy
	â€¢	matplotlib
	â€¢	scipy.stats

ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset contains:
	â€¢	Impression (Number of Ad Views)
	â€¢	Click (Number of Clicks)
	â€¢	Purchase (Number of Purchases)
	â€¢	Earning (Revenue)

Two groups were analyzed separately:
	â€¢	Control Group (Old Ad Strategy)
	â€¢	Test Group (New Ad Strategy)

ðŸ§ª Hypotheses
	â€¢	H0 (Null Hypothesis): The mean Purchase values of the Control and Test groups are equal.
	â€¢	H1 (Alternative Hypothesis): The mean Purchase values of the Control and Test groups are different.

ðŸ“ˆ Conclusion
	â€¢	Both groups were normally distributed and had equal variances.
	â€¢	Based on the t-test results, the p-value > 0.05.
	â€¢	Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
	â€¢	Result: There is no statistically significant difference between the purchase means of the control and test groups.
